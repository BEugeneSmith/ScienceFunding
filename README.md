## Science Funding Data Analysis
This is an analysis of NSF funding over the past five years for the areas I'm interested in for advanced degrees.

Currently, there is only an analysis of terms extracted from from abstracts of projects along with their funding. Given that datasets are released every Fall, it will be interesting to see how close the prediction comes to this year's awards. To see the rendered notebook (should be complete 8/15/2015) go [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/BEugeneSmith7/ScienceFunding/blob/master/SFAnalysis.ipynb). Otherwise, I invite you to poke around this repository and suggest changes.

Thanks!,
Eugene
