## Science Funding Data Analysis
This is an analysis of NSF funding over the past five years for the areas I'm specifically considering for graduate school.

Currently, there is only an analysis of terms extracted from from the abstracts of the projects, but in the future I intend to also analyze the amount of funds that were put into each project. Given that datasets are released every Fall, I will also create a model and see if any trends can be observed in funding for different areas and states.

Thanks for checking this out, dear reader!
